# Spacebro UI

A tool to visualize and edit your spacebro graph.

## ❓Why ?

A long time ago, in the dark ages, we had nothing to see the connections
made between app by spacebro. We had to dig into each client's settings
file to find hints, and draw by hand the result with poska pens on A3
papers.  
This time is over. We now have spacebroUI that connects to spacebro, ask
for clients and connections, and automagically draw a graph of clients
and connections.
You can also edit the connections from here.
